# Environment

## Getting Started on Windows

The Qt library has to be built with the same version of MSVC as Python and PySide, this can be selected when using the online installer.

### Requirements

- [MSVC2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or (MSVC2019) for Python 3 on Windows.
- [OpenSSL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openssl/) (optional for SSL support, Qt must have been configured using the same SSL library).
- `sphinx` package for the documentation (optional).

> Python 3.8.0 was missing some API required for PySide/Shiboken so itâ€™s not possible to use it for a Windows build.
